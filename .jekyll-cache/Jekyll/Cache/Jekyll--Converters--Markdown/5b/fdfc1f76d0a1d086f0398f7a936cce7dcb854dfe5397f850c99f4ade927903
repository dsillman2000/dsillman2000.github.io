This page tells you a little about me.
<br /><br />
I attended Purdue University and graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s in Data Science and
Math in May of 2022. I currently work for Intuitive Surgical as a data analyst. Some
of my passions include writing music, recreational programming, and math.
<br /><br />
My blog on this website was started to contain the results or notes about personal
projects I work on as well as miscellanea about whatâ€™s currently going on in my
life.
<br /><br />
This site was compiled via the Ruby blogging library, Jekyll.</p>
