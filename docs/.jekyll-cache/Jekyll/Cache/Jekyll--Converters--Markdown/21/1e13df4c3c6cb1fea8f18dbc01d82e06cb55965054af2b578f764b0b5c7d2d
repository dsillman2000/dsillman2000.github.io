I"”<p>Â Â Â Â  Iâ€™ve spent the past two weeks just starting to get a handle
on how to use the popular low-level, memory-safe programming language Rust. In general,
it gives me C++ vibes when Iâ€™m programming in it. That said, I think that it could have
good potential as a machine learning development environment, so long as it is
supplied with the appropriate external libraries (or â€œcrates,â€ to use Rustâ€™s
terminology.)</p>

<p><br />
Â Â Â Â  So, to get a handle on how I could use Rust specifically
for machine learning purposes, I did some (very brief) research into what tools
might be useful. I knew that I wanted to make use of an <em>auto-differentiation</em>
tool, as this is essentially the bedrock of a machine learning dev environment.
Auto-differentiation allows us to compute partial derivatives of the output of
our models such that we can tweak and tune them into being better predictors.</p>
