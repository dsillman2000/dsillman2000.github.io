I"”<p>Â Â Â Â A banana is an edible fruit â€“ botanically a berry â€“ produced by several kinds
of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</p>

<p><br />
Â Â Â Â In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called â€œplantainsâ€,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.</p>
