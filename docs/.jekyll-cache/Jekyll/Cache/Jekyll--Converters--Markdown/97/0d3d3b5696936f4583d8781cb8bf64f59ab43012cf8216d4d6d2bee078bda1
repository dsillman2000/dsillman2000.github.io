I"°<p>Â Â Â Â  Iâ€™ve spent the past two weeks just starting to get a handle
on how to use the popular low-level, memory-safe programming language Rust. In general,
it gives me C++ vibes when Iâ€™m programming in it. That said, I think that it could have
good potential as a machine learning development environment, so long as it is
supplied with the appropriate external libraries (or â€œcrates,â€ to use Rustâ€™s
terminology.)</p>
