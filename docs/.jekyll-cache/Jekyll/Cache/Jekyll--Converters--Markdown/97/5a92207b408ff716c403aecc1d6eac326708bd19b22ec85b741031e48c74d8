<p>     I’ve spent the past two weeks just starting to get a handle
on how to use the popular low-level, memory-safe programming language Rust. In general,
it gives me C++ vibes when I’m programming in it. That said, I think that it could have
good potential as a machine learning development environment, so long as it is
supplied with the appropriate external libraries (or “crates,” to use Rust’s
terminology.)</p>

<p><br />
     So, to get a handle on how I could use Rust specifically
for machine learning purposes, I did some (very brief) research into what tools
might be useful. I knew that I wanted to make use of an <em>auto-differentiation</em>
tool, as this is essentially the bedrock of a machine learning dev environment.
Auto-differentiation allows us to compute partial derivatives of the output of
our models such that we can tweak and tune them into being better predictors. I looked
over three different auto-differentiation crates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/easy-ml"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easy-ml</code></a> : This is actually a much more comprehensive
machine learning crate with lots of out-of-the-box machine learning implementations
which are directly callable. it also contains a module,
<a href="https://docs.rs/easy-ml/1.8.1/easy_ml/differentiation/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">differentiation</code></a>
which houses its auto-differentiation engine. This module could suffice for my purposes,
but I don’t like the overhead of needing to install all of the extra bells and whistles
provided by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easy-ml</code> just to get access to its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">differentiation</code> module. I’d rather
use a crate which contains only the necessary tools &amp; traits for auto-differentiation
in particular.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/autodiff"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autodiff</code></a> : The problem with using this crate
in particular is that it is mostly tailored toward calculus on scalar functions,
whereas most machine learning applications require higher-dimensional differentiation
in the form of vectors, matrices and scalars. I don’t know if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autodiff</code> is necessarily
incapable of implementing these features, but most of their examples and documentation
emphasize their scalar equivalents.</li>
  <li><a href="https://link-url-here.org"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autograd</code></a></li>
</ul>
