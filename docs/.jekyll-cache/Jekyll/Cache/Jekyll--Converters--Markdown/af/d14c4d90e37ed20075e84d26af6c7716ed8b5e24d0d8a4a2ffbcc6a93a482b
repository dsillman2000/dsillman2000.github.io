I"À<p>Â Â Â Â Beginning with this blog post, I am going to start a post series which seeks to summarize Walter Rudinâ€™s highly popular real analysis textbook, <em>Principles of Real Analysis (3ed)</em>, published in 1976.</p>

<p><br />
Â Â Â Â Iâ€™m the sort of guy who really enjoys learning about complicated math topics on his own; thereâ€™s a unique sort of satisfaction which is derived from teaching yourself something difficult, even if it means pouring over a textbook in your free time. Moreover, reading some of the most seminal textbooks in pure mathematics will certainly aid in developing reading comprehension skills which make modern mathematics research more parseable (which is a secondary goal of mine).</p>

<p><br />
Â Â Â Â Something Iâ€™m trying to avoid with this post series is simply copying ideas from the book; my hope is that I can gain and share a deeper understanding of the foundational concepts of the book by â€œde-jargoningâ€ it; that is, making it more parseable by math novices (like myself). This might mean explaining key ideas from each chapter with pictures, or translating confusing vocabulary into simpler, ordinary concepts that the average undergrad could understand.</p>
