I"u<p>     I’ve spent the past two weeks just starting to get a handle
on how to use the popular low-level, memory-safe programming language Rust. In general,
it gives me C++ vibes when I’m programming in it. That said, I think that it could have
good potential as a machine learning development environment, so long as it is
supplied with the appropriate external libraries (or “crates,” to use Rust’s
terminology.)</p>

<p><br />
     So, to get a handle on how I could use Rust specifically
for machine learning purposes, I did some (very brief) research into what tools
might be useful. I knew that I wanted to make use of an <em>auto-differentiation</em>
tool, as this is essentially the bedrock of a machine learning dev environment.
Auto-differentiation allows us to compute partial derivatives of the output of
our models such that we can tweak and tune them into being better predictors. I looked
over three different auto-differentiation crates:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/easy-ml"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easy-ml</code></a> : This is actually a much more comprehensive
machine learning crate with lots of out-of-the-box machine learning implementations
which are easy to implement. It also contains a module,
<a href="https://docs.rs/easy-ml/1.8.1/easy_ml/differentiation/index.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">differentiation</code></a>
which houses its auto-differentiation engine. This module could suffice for my purposes,
but I don’t like the overhead of needing to install all of the extra bells and whistles
provided by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">easy-ml</code> just to get access to its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">differentiation</code> module. I’d rather
use a crate which contains only the necessary tools &amp; traits for auto-differentiation
in particular.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/autodiff"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autodiff</code></a> : The problem with using this crate
in particular is that it is mostly tailored toward calculus on scalar functions,
whereas most machine learning applications require higher-dimensional differentiation
in the form of vectors, matrices and scalars. I don’t know if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autodiff</code> is necessarily
incapable of implementing these features, but most of their examples and documentation
emphasize their scalar equivalents.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/autograd"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autograd</code></a> : Of the above two alternatives,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autograd</code> certainly takes the cake for popularity and satisfies my complaints
about the other two. The crate implements auto-differentiation  on the standard
Rust matrix/tensor crate, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ndarray"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code></a>, which can
allow for maximal cross-compatibility with other matrix-related crates. Moreover, it
is very well documented and small enough for me to be able to scan the source code
to answer questions not addressed by the documentation. Moreover, it’s easily extendible
for custom tensor operations and I/O pipelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>     So, I decided to go with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autograd</code> for my auto-differentiation
engine. I could have gone deeper into my research to find other alternatives, but
these three appeared to be the most popular (according to crates.io), and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autograd</code>
serves all of the basic purposes which I am looking for.</p>

<h3 id="linear-regression-as-a-neural-network">Linear Regression as a Neural Network</h3>
<p>     The simplest machine learning application I could come
up with to test this crate out (which wasn’t already done in their tutorials collection)
was a simple linear regression neural network. For those who don’t know, a neural
network is essentially a statistical model which recursively applies a linear regression
and some nonlinear <em>activation</em> function. So, if I wanted to use a neural network
for the purposes of a simple, one-dimensional linear regression, I would use a 1D
input layer connected directly to a 1D output layer with no activation function.
The weight parameter of the single neuron in this network corresponds to the slope
of our linear regression, while its bias parameter is the offset. This is why the
output equation of our model would look exactly like the formula for a line:</p>

\[y = mx + b \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad y = \text{weight}\cdot x + \text{bias}\]

<p>     In a diagram, this linear regression model looks like the
neural network pictured below:</p>

<p><br />

<p><br />
     Obviously, if this was all I wanted to use my auto-differentiation
engine for, it would be woefully overpowered, but this is just a simple “hello world.”
More generally, if I really wanted (only) to implement a linear regression algorithm
in Rust, I would just use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques">closed-form formula for a linear regression</a> and use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ndarray-linalg</code> for matrix multiplications and inverses to implement it. However,
in future, I’d like to construct more complicated neural models which will require the
full power of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autograd</code>, so this is a small proof-of-concept which allows me to get
comfortable with the crate.</p>

<p><br />
     Now that I have a basic idea of what sort of model I’m
going to be building, I can start writing some Rust code.</p>
