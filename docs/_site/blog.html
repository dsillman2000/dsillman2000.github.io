      <p>     I’ve spent the past two weeks just starting to get a handle
on how to use the popular low-level, memory-safe programming language Rust. In general,
it gives me C++ vibes when I’m programming in it. That said, I think that it could have
good potential as a machine learning development environment, so long as it is
supplied with the appropriate external libraries (or “crates,” to use Rust’s
terminology.)</p>

      <p>    Beginning with this blog post, I am going to start a post series which seeks to summarize Walter Rudin’s highly popular 1976 real analysis textbook, <em>Principles of Real Analysis (3ed)</em>, chapter-by-chapter. In this post, I introduce the book and state my goals with the upcoming post series.</p>
