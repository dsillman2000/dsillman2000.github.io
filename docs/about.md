This page tells you a little about me.
\\
\\
I attended Purdue University and graduated with a Bachelor's in Data Science and
Math in May of 2022. I currently work for Intuitive Surgical as a data engineer. Some
of my passions include writing music, recreational programming, and math. My blog on 
this website was started to contain the results or notes about personal projects I work
on as well as miscellanea about what's currently going on in my life.

This static site was compiled via the Ruby blogging library, Jekyll and Tailwind CSS.
